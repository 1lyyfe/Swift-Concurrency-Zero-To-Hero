    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - delaySeconds: The artificial latency before returning, in seconds. Defaults to 3.0s to make suspension visible during teaching.
    ///   - fail: When `true`, throws ``NetworkError/server`` after delay.
    /// - Returns: A sample quote string.
    /// - Throws: ``NetworkError`` for simulated server issues, or `CancellationError` if the task is cancelled.
    /// - Important: Always prefer **cooperative cancellation** for async work. Using `Task.checkCancellation()` around suspension points
    ///              prevents stale work from completing.
