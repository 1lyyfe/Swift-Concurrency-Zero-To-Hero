# What is Swift Concurrency?

Swift Concurrency solves three chronic issues with callback-based async code:
1. **Control-flow opacity** — nested closures obscure the true sequence.
2. **Error hygiene** — ad-hoc error propagation leads to missed paths.
3. **Lifespan management** — orphaned tasks keep running without owners.

How Swift fixes it:
- `async/await` makes async code read like sync code.
- **Structured concurrency** ties child tasks to the parent lifecycle.
- First-class **cancellation** encourages cooperative termination.
- **MainActor** annotation makes UI updates safe and explicit.
